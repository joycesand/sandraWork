    <p>You're here because you want to build websites. That's a pretty good plan these days. Who doesn't want to make
        groovy, cool sites like the ones we all know and use to stay in touch with our friends, to foster social good,
        and more?</p>
    <div>You might've already heard "Oh, just start with HTML!" Just start with CSS!" when you ask about how to begin
        learning programming.</div>
    <p>That advice is pretty solid.</p>


    <div>
        <ul>
            <li class="first done">HTML</li>
            <li class="second done">CSS</li>
            <li class="third">JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p id="Parent">Mummy</p>
        <p id="child-1">Chelsea Apwoyo</p>
        <p id="child-2">Angella Amaro</p>
        <p id="child-3">Hosanna Ageno</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Sub-item 2A</li>
            <li>Sub-item 2B</li>
            <img src="images/twitter.png">
        </ol>
        </li>

    
    <p style="color: mediumvioletred">We'll explore both languages and write your first snippets of each. Let's start
        with
        something a little more familiar: web pages!</p>

    <h1>I love HTML and CSS</h1>

    <h2>CSS Font Family</h2>
    <p class="serif">This separation is exactly the same for web pages.</p>
    <p class="sansserif">CSS covers the second concern: customizing the appearance of that content to visually bring it
        to life.</p>

    <p>The font-size of this document is 16px.</p>
    <div>The font-size of this div element is 120%</div>
    <p>The % unit sets font size relative to the current font-size.</p>

    <p>Click the "Try it" button to set the display property of the DIV element to "none".</p>
    <div id="my DIV">This is my DIV element</div>
    <p><br>Note:</br>The element will not take up any space when the display property set to "none".</p>

    <p>CSS covers <span style="color: blue">The second concern</span> and this is <span
            style="color: olivedrab">Customizing the appearance.</span></p>

    <h1>The padding property</h1>
    <p class="exl">Writing the two languages separately means that it's much easier just to focus on content or
        appearance without worrying about both at the same time. For example, let's say Open Classrooms were to entirely
        overhaul its brand colors and design.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Padding creates extra space within an element, while margin creates an extra space around
        an
        element!</p>
